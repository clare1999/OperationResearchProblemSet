#### Course Overview
This is intended to be an introduction course to the famous computer software package MATLAB, which has been widely utilized in various fields. It covers the basic usage of MATLAB, optimization, and statistics. You will learn to develop the skills to generate readable, compact and verifiably correct MATLAB scripts and functions to obtain numerical solutions to a wide range of models and to display the results with fully annotated graphics. These skills are essential and can be used to solve problems in various disciplines.
 
Generally speaking, the course is optional and designed for all qualified advanced undergraduates and first-year graduates. However, it would be especially helpful if you are already a graduate, or you are targeted at your graduate study in a business school. You need to manage your spare time more efficiently than others since it needs some programming work. Therefore, the course is not recommended for the students who are interns or in the job market.
